# PyQt5 for Beginners



#### 1. Introduction

PyQt5 is a popular alternative to Tkinter, Pythons default GUI toolkit. Qt is a GUI toolkit written in C++ and has bindings for [several programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_bindings_for_Qt_5). You can find a non exaustive list of applications written in PyQt5 [on the Python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt/SomeExistingApplications).

This tutorial is a simple guide to PyQt5 for beginners. To follow it you need to be familiar with basic Python constructs including object oriented programming, lambda functions and list comprehensions, so if you need, please refresh your knowledge on these topics. You also need to know some [event driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming) concepts.
